# Purpose:
# - read 16-bit audio samples from a stereo formatted WAV file 
#   stored in the internal MicroPython filesystem
# - write audio samples to an I2S amplifier or DAC module 
#
# Sample WAV file in wav_files folder:
#   "side-to-side-8k-16bits-stereo.wav"
#
# Hardware tested:
# - PCM5102 stereo DAC module
#
# The WAV file will play continuously until a keyboard interrupt is detected or
# the ESP32 is reset
